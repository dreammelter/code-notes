# code-notes
A random peek into the code notebook that isn't my code notebook. (I live in OneNote and Obsidian.)
Not much here at the moment. They're also still catered to my weaknesses, curiousities, and learning style in particular.

## Contents
**Spawn Points (2022)**
- Wanted to test an idea regarding X/Y coordinates and (barely) learned about event propagation in the process.
- TIL click events don't register to spec on Safari mobile. Apple probably did it for security but...

**Microsoft Clone (2020)**
- Intro to CSS Flex and Media Queries grid a la [Traversy Media's Tut](https://youtu.be/uKgn-To1C4Q)
- is a singular ebpage, but github pages is not enabled for viewing the result. (maybe next time.)

**JavaScript Basics (2019):**
- Syntax and feature reviews to update myself on the language and new ES6 bits
- mostly comments and outputs to a console.
- (was also used to live demo scripting languages to my classmates.)
