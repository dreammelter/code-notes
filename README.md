# code-notes
Shareable copies of (some) of my notes and studies.
(Not much here at the moment. They're also still catered to my weaknesses, curiousities, and learning style in particular.)

## Contents
**Microsoft Clone (2020)**
- Intro to CSS Flex and Media Queries grid a la [Traversy Media's Tut](https://youtu.be/uKgn-To1C4Q)
- is a singular ebpage, but github pages is not enabled for viewing the result. (maybe next time.)

**JavaScript Basics (2019):**
- Syntax and feature reviews to update myself on the language and new ES6 bits
- mostly comments and outputs to a console.
